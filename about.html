          <p>
            After many years in academia, teaching high school and college
            students, I desired new challenges to hone other skills and
            contribute to society in new ways. I decided to dedicate myself to
            learning to code at Denver's
            <a href="https://turing.io/">Turing School of Software and Design</a
            >. This opportunity gave me the skills to enter today's software
            development workforce, with a focus on Test Driven Development,
            Agile work practices, and workflow best practices.
            <br />
            <br />
            On top of my passion for technology, my personal interests include
            performing music and helping others learn new skills, such as
            coding. We're all in this together, and I believe in the power of
            collaboration and teamwork.
